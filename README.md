Avocado Bugfixes - a Chrome Browser Extension
================

Installable extension in Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/avocado-bugfixes/hkfedbcdapnpekiomphniaeeomdlofia

Fix bugs in Avocado.io, since it is barely being maintained. Requests & contributions welcome.
Small bugfixes for the Avocado.io website. Avocado is a great service but visual bugs are not being fixed very quickly. This extension will:

1. Prevent excessive scrollbars in messages
2. Prevent every link within a message from being shown as an embedded YouTube video clip

Bugfix requests and contributions are welcome.


Quick Notes
-----------
These are pretty inadequate, but if anyone needs help getting started let me 
know. I am happy to write more and help.

1. The file "avocado-bugfix.zip" is the current released version. Install by 
going to Chrome's Extensions page and doing "Load Packed Extension". Choose
the file and it will load. 
2. You can regenerate the file by running ```make```.
3. You can live-run it by doing #1 except "Load Unpacked Extension". Choose
the directory itself instead of the zip file. Then you can click "Reload" to 
pick up direct changes.
